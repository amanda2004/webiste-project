            Hi, my name is Mandy! I live in Jakarta, where I am pursuing a
            bachelor degree in Information Systems. My passion for technology
            has always driven me to explore new possibilities, and this journey
            led me to focus on cloud computing, with a specific interest in
            becoming a skilled back-end developer. I love the idea of building
            complex applications and websites that solve real-world problems
            through logic and creativity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Alongside my academic pursuits, I also have a creative side—I enjoy
            making content for TikTok and Instagram. Social media has become a
            fun way for me to share my interests and experiences with others,
            and it's one of my favorite hobbies.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of my proudest achievements was winning the international
            competition “ACIYLS 2023,” where I represented Indonesia in
            Singapore. During the competition, I had the honor of leading a team
            to develop a start-up idea that tackled sustainable challenges. This
            experience sharpened my leadership and problem-solving skills and
            gave me valuable insights into the start-up world.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also have hands-on experience in product management through a
            project called "Reminderoo," a subscription management platform that
            my team and I developed. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge
            further by joining the Cloud Computing path at Bangkit 2024, where I
            am learning cutting-edge technologies to advance my career in tech.

              As a Product Manager, I played a pivotal role in developing
              "Reminderoo," a subscription management platform designed to
              simplify users' financial tracking. My responsibilities included
              coordinating team efforts, defining product features, and ensuring
              we addressed user needs effectively. This project allowed me to
              hone my project management skills and understand the intricacies
              of building a product from the ground up.

            <p>
              In 2023, I had the incredible opportunity to represent Indonesia
              at the international competition "ACIYLS 2023" in Singapore. As a
              group leader, I guided my team in creating a start-up focused on
              addressing sustainable challenges. This experience not only
              enhanced my leadership capabilities but also deepened my
              understanding of sustainable practices in business. It was a
              remarkable journey that taught me the importance of innovation and
              collaboration.
